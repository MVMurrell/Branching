## Branching Notes

This will list ways to create and manage branches.

`git branch` - lists branches that you have locally and highlights the branch you are currently using

`git branch BRANCH_NAME`- create a new branch called BRANCH_NAME

Before you intend to merge a branch pull from `master` locally.
